# BurnedPizzaClassifier
Playing with https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ drag and drop machine learning (using mobile net) and answering the question: **Is the pizza burned**?
The start up idea is already taken https://dompizzachecker.dominos.com.au.

You can try by uploading your ow image at

I want to give object detection next.

TODO need more pictures (most of them are form restaurant reviews).
All images stored in data folder.
